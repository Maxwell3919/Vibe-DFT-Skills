Run a First Calculation



This page walks through a small single-point energy calculation for a water molecule. It uses the

Quickstep

module, the Gaussian and plane wave (

GPW

) method, a molecular Gaussian

basis set, and Goedecker-Teter-Hutter (

GTH

) pseudopotentials. The example is intentionally

small enough to run in a few seconds while still showing the parts of a typical CP2K input file that

matter for larger calculations.

Running CP2K



Run the calculation with one of the installed CP2K binaries:

OMP_NUM_THREADS

=

1

cp2k.psmp

-i

h2o.inp

-o

h2o.out

The executable name depends on how CP2K was built:

executable

meaning

cp2k.psmp

MPI + OpenMP parallel build

cp2k.pdbg

MPI + OpenMP debug build

cp2k.ssmp

serial/OpenMP build

cp2k.sdbg

serial/OpenMP debug build

For MPI-parallel runs, launch CP2K through the MPI launcher used on your system, for example:

mpirun

-np

2

-x

OMP_NUM_THREADS

=

1

cp2k.psmp

-i

h2o.inp

-o

h2o.out

cp2k.psmp

supports both MPI and OpenMP. Setting

OMP_NUM_THREADS=1

keeps this first example in a

simple MPI-only layout. To see the output on screen while also saving it, replace

-o

h2o.out

with

|

tee

h2o.out

.

What the Input Does



RUN_TYPE

is set to

ENERGY

, so CP2K evaluates the electronic ground

state energy without moving the atoms.

METHOD

selects

Quickstep

, CP2K’s electronic-structure module for

Gaussian-based density functional theory and related methods.

BASIS_SET_FILE_NAME

and

POTENTIAL_FILE_NAME

tell CP2K where to find the basis-set and

pseudopotential libraries. The matching

KIND

sections then

choose one Gaussian basis set and one GTH pseudopotential for each element.

CUTOFF

and

REL_CUTOFF

control the real-space integration grids

used by the GPW method. They are not a replacement for increasing the Gaussian basis quality; for

accurate work the basis set and grid parameters should be converged together.

The

POISSON

section and the

CELL

section both use

PERIODIC

NONE

, which is appropriate

for this isolated molecule in a large non-periodic box.

Checking the Result



At the end of

h2o.out

, CP2K prints the total energy in Hartree:

ENERGY| Total FORCE_EVAL ( QS ) energy [hartree]

You should also see a line stating that the self-consistent field (

SCF

) cycle converged. If

the SCF cycle does not converge, increase

MAX_SCF

, improve the initial guess, or use a more robust

SCF setup.

The timing table printed at the end of every CP2K run is useful for a first performance check. For

larger calculations, compare timings between MPI/OpenMP layouts and watch whether most of the time

is spent in grid operations, sparse matrix operations, diagonalization, or communication.
